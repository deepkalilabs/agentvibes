# CosmicNotebook 🌟

Jupyter notebooks deserve more love. We want to help teams ship technical AI-workflows (see our recipes section for examples) from a notebook to production API within 10 minutes without relying on engineering or infra teams.

## 💡 Why CosmicNotebook?

Jupyter notebooks are great but functionality is severely limited to prototyping and experimentation. We believe teams should be shipping code directly from notebooks without having to rely on engineering or infra teams. With AI-powered code generation, we believe it's possible to:

- Ship the notebook code to production with a click
- Eliminate manual code refactoring 
- Manage dependencies automatically
- Provide production-grade scheduling
- Enable team collaboration
- Maintain security and compliance
